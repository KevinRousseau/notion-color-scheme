# 🎨 Notion Inspired color scheme

If you like using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) like many people, and you're a developer, you might have used the **code blocks**.

With this **Notion Inspired** light color scheme I attempt to replicate the ✨ look and feel ✨of the code blocks color scheme within Notion.
